# Exim: OS-specific make file for SCO SVR4.2MP (and maybe Unixware)
#
#  *** Note that for SCO 5 the configuration file is called SCO_SV,
#  *** and that Unixware7 has its own configuration. This is an old
#  *** file that is retained for compatibility.
#
# Note that SCO does not include dbm/ndbm with their standard compiler
# (it is available with /usr/ucb/cc, but that has bugs of its own). You
# should install gcc and gdbm, then execute 'make install-compat' in the
# gdbm source directory.
