### Mitigations

If you take care in setting up your systemd unit file, you'll be pleasantly surprised to see that exploitation is somewhat contained:

```
[Unit]
Description=Gogs
After=syslog.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=gogs
Group=gogs
WorkingDirectory=/home/gogs/installations/gogs/
ExecStart=/home/gogs/installations/gogs/gogs web
Restart=always
Environment=USER=gogs HOME=/home/gogs

# Some distributions may not support these hardening directives. If you cannot start the service due
# to an unknown option, comment out the ones not supported by your version of systemd.
ProtectSystem=full
PrivateDevices=yes
PrivateTmp=yes
NoNewPrivileges=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This will at least keep filesystem access contained to an ephemeral filesystem created by systemd. It helps, but you should probably patch the privesc and not give any admin.. obviously
