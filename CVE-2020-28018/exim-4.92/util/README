The "util" directory in the Exim distribution
---------------------------------------------

This directory contains some small scripts that people have contributed which
may be useful to others. They are probably not usable immediately without at
least some minor editing. Take them as starting points.

cramtest.pl
-----------

A Perl script to help with debugging CRAM-MD5 authentication.

logargs.sh
----------

A shell script to interpose between a caller and Exim, to find out what command
line arguments it is trying to use.

mkcdb.pl
--------

A Perl script for a converting flat file into a format that is suitable for
processing by cdbmake into a cdb file. It has some advantages over the
cdbmake-12 awk script.

ratelimit.pl
------------

A Perl script for computing peak sending rates from a log file. This is for
use with the ratelimit ACL condition, so that you can get some idea of what a
reasonable limit would be before deploying the feature.

unknownuser.sh
--------------

This is historical, dating to the time when people tried to send back a helpful
message when an incoming message's recipient was unknown. It recalls a
different age...
