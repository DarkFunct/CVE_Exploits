<p>
Occasionally, one might want to run ProFTPD on a system where root privs
are not available to you as a user.  It is still possible to setup a
functioning FTP server without root privileges.  There are a few catches
and special considerations for this, however.

<p>
Here are the configuration directives that you will need to use in order
to run the server without root privileges:<br>

<ul>
  <li><b><code>Port</code></b><br>
  This needs to be a number greater than 1023.  Lower number ports require
  root privileges in order for the process to bind to that address.  This
  will also mean that clients wishing to contact your server will need to
  know the port on which it is listening.  Most FTP clients connect to the
  standard FTP port (21).
 
  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    Port 20021
</pre>
  </li>
 
  <li><b><code>AuthUserFile, AuthGroupFile</code></b><br> 
  In order to authenticate users, by default the server looks in
  <code>/etc/passwd</code> for account information, and in
  <code>/etc/shadow</code> for the password.  Comparing stored passwords
  requires root privileges, which this nonroot-running daemon will not have.
  You can get around this requirement by supplying your own passwd (and
  possibly group) files via the <a href="../modules/mod_auth_file.html#AuthUserFile"><code>AuthUserFile</code></a> and
  <a href="../modules/mod_auth_file.html#AuthGroupFile"><code>AuthGroupFile</code></a> directives.  Make sure the permissions on your
  custom files allow for the daemon to read them (but hopefully not other
  users).

  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    AuthUserFile /path/to/custom/ftpd.passwd
    AuthGroupFile /path/to/custom/ftpd.group
</pre>
  </li>

  <li><b><code>AuthPAM</code></b><br>
  PAM authentication requires root privileges.  This directive will need
  to be set <i>off</i>.
  
  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    AuthPAM off
</pre>
  </li>

  <p>
  <li><b><code>PidFile</code></b><br>
  This directive will need to be used to cause the server to write its PID
  to some file writable by the user.

  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    PidFile /home/bob/ftpd/proftpd.pid
</pre>
  </li>

  <p>
  <li><b><code>ScoreboardFile</code></b><br>
  This directive will need to be used to cause the server to write its
  scoreboard to some file writable by the user.

  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    ScoreboardFile /home/bob/ftpd/proftpd.scoreboard
</pre>
  </li>

  <li><b><code>WtmpLog</code></b><br>
  Logging to <code>wtmp</code> files requires root privileges.  While it is
  not strictly necessary for this directive to be set to <i>off</i>, failure
  to do so will result in server log messages like:
<pre>
  host.domain.net (localhost[127.0.0.1]) - wtmpx /var/adm/wtmpx: Permission denied
</pre> 

  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    WtmpLog off
</pre>
  </li>

  <li><b><code>User, Group</code></b><br>
  The ability to switch the identity of the server process to those configured
  by the <a href="../modules/mod_core.html#Userl"><code>User</code></a> and
  <a href="../modules/mod_core.html#Group"><code>Group</code></a> directives requires, of course, root privileges.  It is best to
  configure <code>User</code> to be your username, and <code>Group</code> to
  be the name of your primary group (which is usually the first group listed
  by the <code>groups</code> command).

  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    User bob
    Group bob
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that other configuration directives will be affected by the lack of
root privileges:  <code>DefaultRoot</code> will not work, nor will
<code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code> sections, nor <code>UserOwner</code>.
Basically any operation that requires root privileges will be disabled.

<p>
If using the <code>SystemLog</code> directive, make sure the file to which the
server is to log can be written to by the configured daemon <code>User</code>
or <code>Group</code>.

<p>
The daemon should now start successfully.  Complaints about not being able
to switch UIDs and such will be logged, but the daemon should still function
properly.
