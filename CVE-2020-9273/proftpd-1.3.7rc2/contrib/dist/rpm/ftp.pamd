# If this is enabled, anonymous logins will fail because the 'ftp' user does
# not have a "valid" shell, as listed in /etc/shells.
#
# If you enable this, it is recommended that you do *not* give the 'ftp'
# user a real shell. Instead, give the 'ftp' user /bin/false for a shell and
# add /bin/false to /etc/shells.
