3.1.2 - Para 4 (records with Sel Full(0) are discouraged)
==> There's a matching type Full but not such a Selector type.
    Should this be "Cert(0), or Matching Type Full(0)" ?
    Suspect the latter.

3.1.2 Needs a para added regarding certificate date verification,
    to contrast with the requirement to NOT check for
    DANE-EE defined in 3.1.1
