# Exim: OS-specific make file for AIX

# Note that the output of uname -m is probably not what Philip expected,
# so you might end up with more build-AIX-random_number directories than
# you expected if you have too many AIX boxes, but it seems to work... I
# blame IBM.

# Note that nowadays you have to pay extra for a cc compiler with AIX!

CC=gcc

# This needs to be in here rather than os.h-AIX because of regexp stuff.
# basically strchr is a #define, which means "extern char *strchr()"
# ruins things. __STR31__ seems to get around this by magic. The AIX
# include files are quite a confusing maze.
# Mike M says this is not necessary any more; possibly this is related to
# using gcc. Commented out by PH.
#CFLAGS = -D__STR31__

CFLAGS = -mcpu=power4 -maix64 -O3

# Needed for vfork() and vfork() only?

LIBS = -lbsd -lm
