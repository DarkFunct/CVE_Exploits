<p>
<b>What is Tracing?</b><br>
"Tracing" is a new form of logging, introduced in the 1.3.1 ProFTPD release
series.

<p>
Trace logging has the concept of multiple logging <i>channels</i>, each of
which has its own log <i>level</i>.  Layers and APIs within the ProFTPD source
will tend to use their own channels.  There is no limit to the number of
different log channels that can be supported.

<p>
Within a channel, the assumption is that lower log levels indicate higher
priority or importance.  Or to look at it another way, the higher the log
level for channel, the more noisy that log channel might be.  The lowest log
level is 1; there is no upper log level limit.

<p>
Why have this new form of logging, in addition to all the other kinds of logs
(<i>e.g.</i> <code>SystemLog</code>, <code>ExtendedLog</code>, <i>etc</i>)
that a <code>proftpd</code> daemon can currently produce?  The usual
<code>SystemLog</code> of proftpd debug logging, at a high
<code>DebugLevel</code>, was becoming unreadable; it is difficult to find the
tidbits of knowledge amidst the other messages in that file.  By separating
log messages into channels and levels, tracing gives the administrator a much
finer-grained control over the logging, given them a way of focusing the
logging more narrowly, so only the area of code of interest is logged.

<p>
Support for tracing is enabled by default.  Use the
<code>--disable-trace</code> configure option, when compiling ProFTPD, to
disable all tracing support.  I recommend that high-traffic production sites,
which have no need for debug logging at this granularity, use the
<code>--disable-trace</code> option.

<p>
<b>Configuration Directives</b><br>
There are two new configuration directives for tracing: <code>TraceLog</code>
and <code>Trace</code>.  Note that for tracing to be effective, these
two directives, if used, <i>must</i> appear at the start of your
<code>proftpd.conf</code> file, before any other directives.

<p>
The <code>TraceLog</code> directive specifies a filename to which to write
the tracing log messages.  For example:
<pre>
  TraceLog /var/ftpd/trace.log
</pre>
Without this directive, no trace logging will occur.

<p>
Once you have configured your <code>TraceLog</code>, you will use the
<code>Trace</code> directive to control the verbosity of that log:
<pre>
  Trace <i>channel1</i>:<i>level1</i> <i>channel2</i>:<i>level2</i> ...
</pre>
This directive lets you set each log channel and its level differently,
<i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
  Trace command:5 response:8 timer:2 config:9
</pre>
There is also support for a special "DEFAULT" keyword:
<pre>
  Trace DEFAULT:10
</pre>
The following is the list of channels which are covered by the "DEFAULT"
keyword:
<ul>
  <li>auth
  <li>binding
  <li>command
  <li>config
  <li>ctrls
  <li>data
  <li>delay
  <li>dns
  <li>dso
  <li>encode
  <li>error
  <li>event
  <li>facl
  <li>fsio
  <li>ident
  <li>inet
  <li>lock
  <li>log
  <li>module
  <li>netacl
  <li>netio
  <li>pam
  <li>pool
  <li>regexp
  <li>response
  <li>scoreboard
  <li>signal
  <li>site
  <li>timer
  <li>var
</ul>
This means that if you use the following in your <code>proftpd.conf</code>
file, at the very top:
<pre>
  TraceLog /path/to/ftpd/trace.log
  Trace DEFAULT:10
</pre>
Then <b>all</b> of the above channels, up to log level 10, will have their
messages logged.

<p>
If you want to look at the default trace channels <i>except</i> for a
particular channel, use level 0 to effectively disable that channel.
For example, to exclude the "fsio" channel but see the rest of the default
channels, you would use:
<pre>
  Trace DEFAULT:10 fsio:0
</pre>

<p>
Note that there are trace channel names that are <b>not</b> part of the
"DEFAULT" channel name list (<i>e.g.</i> "class"); any custom channel names,
such as might be used by a third-party module, are also not covered in the
"DEFAULT" list.  For example, the <code>mod_tls</code> module may log to a
"tls" channel.  Any messages to that "tls" channel would not appear in the
<code>TraceLog</code> file, using the above configuration.  Instead,
you would need to explicitly mention the "tls" channel, <i>i.e.</i>:
<pre>
  TraceLog /path/to/ftpd/trace.log
  Trace DEFAULT:10 tls:10
</pre>

<p>
<b>Optional Trace Log Channels</b><br>
In addition to the default trace log channels listed above, there are
optional trace log channels:
<ul>
  <li><code>directory</code>
    <p>
    The "directory" log channel is used when the core engine attempts
    to find the closest matching <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> section
    for a path.
  </li>

  <p>
  <li><code>fileperms</code>
    <p>
    The "fileperms" log channel is used whenever a user action involving
    the filesystem (<i>e.g.</i> opening/closing/writing/renaming/deleting
    files or directories) fails.  This channel will log the relevant FTP
    command, user name, UID/GID, filesystem path, and the error.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Trace Log Format</b><br>
Every log message in a <code>TraceLog</code> uses the following format:
<pre>
  <i>timestamp [process ID] &lt;channel:level&gt;: message</i>
</pre>
For example:
<pre>
  Jan 16 17:15:58 [30583] &lt;auth:6&gt;: dispatching auth request "endgrent" to module mod_auth_unix
</pre>
This shows process ID 30583 logging to the "auth" channel, log level 6, a
message about handling the "endgrent" Auth API request.

<b>Runtime Tracing</b><br>
If Controls support is enabled in your <code>proftpd</code>, <i>and</i>
you are using the <code>mod_ctrls_admin</code> module, then you can also use the
<code>ftpdctl</code> command to adjust the trace logging settings in the
running <code>proftpd</code>, without needing to change your
<code>proftpd.conf</code> file.  See:
<pre>
  <a href="../contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html#trace">doc/contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html#trace</a>
</pre>
for more information on the <code>ftpdctl trace</code> action.

<p>
Here's a concrete example of how tuning the trace logging at runtime can be
useful.  You may need the extra information logged via trace logging in order
to track down/debug some issue, <b>but</b> you do not want to enable trace
logging all of the time in your environment.  Fortunately, it is possible
to make it possible to get the trace logging information you need, when
you need to get it, and then turn the trace logging off <i>all without
restarting proftpd</i>.

<p>
First, you need to configure your <code>proftpd.conf</code> like so:
<pre>
  TraceLog /path/to/proftpd/trace.log
  Trace DEFAULT:0
</pre>
This configuration tells proftpd to direct all trace logging to that
<code>TraceLog</code> file, <i>but</i> to not actually write anything to the
file; the log level zero (0) filters out all trace logging messages.  Start
proftpd with the updated <code>proftpd.conf</code>.  Later, while proftpd is
running, you can tune the tracing using the
<a href="Controls.html"><code>ftpdctl</code></a> utility, like this:
<pre>
  $ ftpdctl trace lock:10 scoreboard:5
</pre>
which dynamically changes the 'lock' trace channel level to 10, and the
'scoreboard' trace channel level to 5.  Once you have gathered the necessary
information in the <code>TraceLog</code> file, you then use <code>ftpdctl</code>
again and restore the trace levels back to zero, effectively turning off
trace logging once more:
<pre>
  $ ftpdctl trace DEFAULT:0
</pre>
Note that the changed settings will only apply to <b>new</b> sessions; this
does <b>not</b> change the trace logging for <i>existing</i> sessions.

<p>
<b>Use Only When Needed</b><br>
Remember that tracing is a <i>verbose</i> (and thus expensive) form of logging,
and thus makes the <code>proftpd</code> daemon run slower.  Tracing should only
ever be used for debugging and development purposes; once your
<code>proftpd</code> is up and running the way you need, you should remove all
<code>Trace</code> and <code>TraceLog</code> directives from your
<code>proftpd.conf</code>.

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Can I configure <code>Trace</code> on a
per-user basis, using <code>mod_ifsession</code>'s <code>&lt;IfUser&gt;</code>?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: You can indeed use <code>mod_ifsession</code>
for <code>Trace</code> configurations, starting in ProFTPD 1.3.4rc1.  To
do this, you need to use the optional "session" keyword in your
<code>Trace</code> configuration, <i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
  &lt;IfUser <i>traced-user</i>&gt;
    Trace session DEFAULT:10
  &lt;/IfUser&gt;
</pre>
This goes for <code>&lt;IfClass&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;IfGroup&gt;</code>
sections as well.
