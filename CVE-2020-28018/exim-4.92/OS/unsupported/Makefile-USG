# Exim: OS-specific make file for Unixware 2.x
#
# Note that Unixware does not include db/dbm/ndbm with their standard compiler
# (it is available with /usr/ucb/cc, but that has bugs of its own). You
# should install gcc and Berkeley DB (or another dbm library if you really
# insist). If you use a different dbm library you will need to override
# DBMLIB below.
#
# DB 1.85 and 2.x can be found at http://www.sleepycat.com/.
# They have different characteristics. See the discussion of dbm libraries
# in doc/dbm.discuss.txt in the Exim distribution.
#
# DB needs to be compiled with gcc and you need a 'cc' in your path
# before the Unixware CC to compile it.
#
# Don't bother even starting to install exim on Unixware unless
# you have installed gcc and use it for everything.
