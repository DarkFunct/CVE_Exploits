UNSOLICITED EMAIL
-----------------

The use, supply or promotion of Exim for the purpose of sending bulk,
unsolicited electronic mail is incompatible with the basic aims of the program,
which revolve around the free provision of a service that enhances the quality
of personal communications. The author of Exim regards indiscriminate
mass-mailing as an antisocial, irresponsible abuse of the Internet.


INCORPORATED CODE
-----------------

A number of pieces of external code are included in the Exim distribution.

 .   Support for the cdb (Constant DataBase) lookup method is provided by code
     contributed by Nigel Metheringham of Planet Online Ltd. which contains
     the following statements:

     This code implements Dan Bernstein's Constant DataBase (cdb) spec.
     Information, the spec and sample code for cdb can be obtained from
     http://www.pobox.com/~djb/cdb.html. This implementation borrows some code
     from Dan Bernstein's implementation (which has no license restrictions
     applied to it).
     _________________________________________________________________________

     The implementation is completely contained within the code of Exim. It
     does not link against an external cdb library.

 .   Client support for Microsoft's "Secure Password Authentication" is pro-
     vided by code contributed by Marc Prud'hommeaux. Server support was
     contributed by Tom Kistner. This includes code taken from the Samba
     project, which is released under the Gnu GPL.


 .   Support for calling the Cyrus "pwcheck" and "saslauthd" daemons is
     provided by code taken from the Cyrus-SASL library and adapted by
     Alexander S. Sabourenkov. The permission notice appears below, in
     accordance with the conditions expressed therein.
