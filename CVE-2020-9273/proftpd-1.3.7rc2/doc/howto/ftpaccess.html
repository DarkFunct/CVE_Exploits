<p>
A <code>.ftpaccess</code> file is meant to function like Apache's
<code>.htaccess</code> file: a file that acts as free-floating section of the
server's configuration file.  If a <code>.ftpaccess</code> file is present in
a directory in which ProFTPD performs some action, ProFTPD will parse that
<code>.ftpaccess</code> file as a configuration file, and act accordingly.
Note that only <i>some</i> configuration directives are allowed in the
<code>.ftpaccess</code> section, though.

<p>
The advantage of having this capability is that users can customize how the
server treats directories that are under the user's control, by using files
placed in those directories, instead of allowing the user to modify the main
server configuration file itself.  The disadvantage is that a user is
capable of possibly overriding a configuration value that was set in the main
configuration file for a specific purpose.

<p>
ProFTPD treats a directory that contains a <code>.ftpaccess</code> file
exactly as if the configuration directives in that file had been placed in
a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> section in the main <code>proftpd.conf</code>
file.  For example, if there is a <code>/home/users/bob</code> directory on
your system, and in that directory there was a <code>.ftpaccess</code> file
that contained:
<pre>
  DirFakeUser on ~
  DirFakeGroup on ~
  Umask 0077
</pre>
it would be treated exactly as if:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /home/users/bob&gt;
    DirFakeUser on ~
    DirFakeGroup on ~
    Umask 0077
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
was written into <code>proftpd.conf</code>.

<p>
The <a href="../modules/mod_core.html#AllowOverride"><code>AllowOverride</code></a> directive can be used to disable ProFTPD's support for <code>.ftpaccess</code> files.
